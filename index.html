		<h1>Nick Boyce</h1>
		<h2>Marketing strategist and entrepreneur with a talent for fusing data, technology, and creativity</h2>
		<p>As <a href="https://spinbrands.com.com" target="_blank">Spin</a>’s Data & Insights Director, I strategies that leverage data to drive business incrementality, working with clients such as Google, Fujifilm, Wowcher, DeadHappy and Magnet Kitchens.</p>
		<p>Previously, I founded <a href="https://pollenary.com" target="_blank">Pollenary</a>, an ad agency that applied agile software development techniques to digital marketing, before its acquisition by Spin. 
		<p>At King & McGaw’s E-Commerce Director, I played a pivotal role in navigating the company through a period of substantial growth and transformation. In a string of roles focussed on technology for the art world, I developed Print on Demand programs for institutions such as Tate, MoMA, The Natural History Museum, Smithsonian, the Art Institute of Chicago, as well as brands such as Disney, Next, B&Q, Selfridges and Habitat.</p>
    		<p>I'm equally comfortable with data analysis, business strategy, leading UX projects and developing copy, code and pixels. I’m excited by working with smart people in an environment of transparency, collaboration and continuous learning.</p>
